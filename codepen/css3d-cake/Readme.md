# Overview

These are the assets used for my CodePen demo *CSS 3D Cake*

## Textures

Texture images in the `textures` directory came from the following locations:

- https://www.goodtextures.com/image/19608/white-metal-roughness
- https://www.cgrepo.com/sif/heavy-dust

> Textures were modified for use in the project.

## CSS and camera.js

- css/3d.css
- css/howto.css
- css/starter.css

These are the general starter files for my CSS 3D projects and were slightly modified, particularly for this project.

- js/camera.js

This is 3D camera API I built for this project.
