# Overview

These are the assets used for my CodePen demo *Fireworks in the mind*

## CSS and attrToggle.js

- css/starter.css
- css/controls.css

These are the general starter files for my CSS projects and were slightly modified, particularly for this project.

- js/attrToggle.js

A `data-attribute` toggler I built for this project.
